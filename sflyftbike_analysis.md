# San Francisco July 2019 and 2020 Lfyt Bike Analysis

Comparison and anlysis of July csv data from Lfyt bike trips in San Francisco through Tableau. 

## Goal 
My goal is to analysize ride data of the same month one year apart. July was the most recent data to be released and my goal was to see if clear differences in ride data could be revealed. I initiall expected to see a decline due to the volotile pandemic and changing soceoeconimc climate of San Francisco. The following
is the summary of the 3 story pages created in Tablau. 

## Summary of story pages 

### Story Page 1 - Initial Comparison

lower total usage by __ % 
When comparing the total bike ridership of July 2019 and July 2020 in San Francisco there is a 40 % decline in usage from 258,102 in 2019 to 154,967. When looking at the start times there were two large waves of  usage increase per hour platauing at 8am and 5 pm. This could show a trend of commuters heading from alternative transportation routes to their final destinations. More evidence of this assumption could be collected by looking at the starting time per hour graphs over the whole 2019. In 2020 rider usage gradually increased each hour from 6am on to 5pm. There are also more rides each how between midnight and 4 am for 2020 even though there is a decrease in total ridership in that year. 



### Story Page 2 - Starting location Map 
The amount of rides per starting location graph was filtered to a minamum of 10+ rides to allow more visual clarity. The removal of sigle ride starting locations , that were fairly evenly disputed across both 2019 and 2020 maps allows for locations of higher frequency to be clearly visualized. 2019 large starting locations near other transportation hubs such as bart and muni stations on market as well as the train station on   4th st can be clearly seen on the 2019 map. This map points to a large amount of riders using the service for commuting. In contrast the 2020 map shows no visible association to the same hot spots that were located on the 2019 map. There are more rides starting locations dispersed evenly around the city in 2020 than there was in 2019. Areas where there were no starting locations in 2019 such as ocean beach and hunters point have muiltple points on the 2020 map. 

### Story Page 3 - Length of Ride Comparison

When comparing the length of ride from 2019 to 2020 there was increase from 14 minutes to 25.5 minutes respectivly. This is an increase of average ride length of 55 %. As the medium of the 2020 graph is moved right inrespect to the 2019 graph the right tail of the graph also has a more gradual decline in ride length thus giving 2020 a much greater average ride length. One point to compare is at the 40 minute mark. there were are only 10 rides of over 40 minutes in 2019 and 4 times that amount of 40 minute rides in 2020. This again points towards more rides that are not used soley for commuting requirements that can be seen in the 2019 data.
